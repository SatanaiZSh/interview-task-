- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
*Min-Max:
A data-normalization approach to ensures that all features have the same scale by converting the lowest value of them into 0,
the highest value into 1, and all others to a decimal between 0 and 1.

*Z-score:
A data-normalization approach that avoids the outliers issues.

```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
*Unit testing is a software testing approach in which individual program components get tested, plus 
it ensures that all code meets quality standards before being deployed.
